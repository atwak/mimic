## description

Adventurers Beware! Do not begin unless you intend to finish.

Danger lurks at every turn and on every turn, as you embark upon this epic adventure. Take a card and read the rhyming messages, then race against time to roll the dice that can save you and your fellow players from the vicious croc's snapping jaws, the stealthy lion's ferocious bite or the charge of the trumpeting elephants. Double-cross your opponents by strategically placing the rampaging rhino to block the path as you scurry towards the centre of the board. Venture into the world of Jumanji if you dare, but be warned: you may not be able to escape the jungle's clutches.
